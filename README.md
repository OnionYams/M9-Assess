# M9-Assess-Group2

`Group Members`
* Jake
* Ahad
* Yansong
* Ryan

Presenting: `SVM`

Implementing: `BIRCH`

Presentation found in M9-ML-Algos, other files in this top level directory pertain to sample code, either running it or files necessary for it to run

The part2 folder contains our implementation of the BIRCH algorithm in Birch implementation, a comparison to the k-means algorithm run on the same data set in K-Means-Comparison and the data we used in animals.csv; to run these just make sure they're in the same folder
